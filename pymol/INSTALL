INSTALLATION VIA COMPILATION 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is currently only one officially-supported approach for building
and installing PyMOL from the open-source code:

    UsingPython Disutils under an open-source environment, such as:

        Linux
        FreeBSD
        Mac OS X under X11 (with Fink or similar)

Note that you must have OpenGL, glut, libpng, tcl/tk, python,
freetype2, and Pmw already installed on your system for this to work.
Nowadays, you can typically use the package manager to automatically
download and install the required components ("apt-get install
python-pmw" or "yum install freetype-devel", etc.)
 
    python setup.py build install
    python setup2.py install
    ./pymol

    Note: under Fink, "python" above must be Fink's python.

Good luck!

PS. There are two other unsupported approaches intended primarily for
developer use, with pymol runningly directly out of the source
directory instead of being installed into an external Python or the
global system Python.

  1. GNU autotools: assumes that all of the external dependencies are
     already installed in your system.  NOTE: 'make install' only
     targets the local directory (.).  This build approach is not
     currently intended for a Python-integrated installation -- see
     the above distutils approach for that -- but it could be quite
     useful in situations where you want to build and maintain
     multiple PyMOL development versions on a single machine, either
     locally, or system-wide.

    NOTE: This method has only been tested on Linux.

    ./configure
    make install
    ./pymol
    make clean (optional, to save space)

  2. DeLano Scientific LLC's internal Makefiles (AS IS/PROPRIETARY):
     assumes that external depencies are already compiled and present
     in a local ./ext subdirectory.
    
    cp setup/Rules.xxxxx Rules.delci # (then configure manually)
    make -f Makefile.delsci
    ./setup/setup.sh
    ./pymol
