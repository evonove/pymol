INSTALLATION VIA COMPILATION 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is currently only one *supported* approach for building and
installing PyMOL from the open-source code: via Python Disutils.

You must have OpenGL, glut, libpng, tcl/tk, python, freetype2, and Pmw
already installed on your system for this to work.

    python setup.py install
    python setup2.py install
    ./pymol

Good luck!

PS. There are two other *unsupported* approaches intended mainly
for development, with pymol runningly directly from this source
directory instead of being installed globally.

  1. GNU autotools: assumes that all of the external dependencies are
     already installed in your system.

    ./configure
    make install
    ./pymol
    
  2. DeLano Scientific LLC's internal Makefiles (proprietary): assumes
     that external depencies are already compiled and present in the
     local ./ext subdirectory.
    
    cp setup/Rules.xxxxx Rules.delci # (then configure manually)
    make -f Makefile.delsci
    ./setup/setup.sh
    ./pymol
