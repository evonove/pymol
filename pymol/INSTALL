INSTALLATION VIA COMPILATION 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is currently only one officially-supported approach for building
and installing PyMOL from the open-source code:

    UsingPython Disutils under an open-source environment, such as:

        Linux
        FreeBSD
        Mac OS X under X11 (with Fink or similar)

    See also: http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Linux_Install

Note that you must have OpenGL, glut, libpng, tcl/tk, python,
freetype2, and Pmw already installed on your system for this to work.
Nowadays, you can typically use the package manager to automatically
download and install the required components ("apt-get install
python-pmw" or "yum install freetype-devel", etc.)

    python setup.py build install --home=~
    ~/bin/pymol

    Note: under Fink, "python" above must be Fink's python.

Good luck!
