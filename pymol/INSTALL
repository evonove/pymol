INSTALLATION

WARNING: You'll need some basic knowledge of Makefiles, compilation
flags, libraries, python, environment variables, and paths in order to
compile PyMOL.  If you don't have this experience, save yourself
frustration and wait until binaries are available for download.

KEY FACTS:

1. A unix system with Python 1.5.2, Glut >=3.0, and libPNG
preinstalled will not need the pymol-ext CVS tree.  However,
installation of PyMOL usually requires compilation of some or all of
the external dependencies in the pymol-ext CVS tree.  You should check
this tree out as well -- but this should only ever need to be done
one.  Compilation instructions for these dependencies are contained in
the INSTALL file.

Hopefully we can soon replace the pymol-ext source code with a set of
precompiled binary libraries for various platforms.  

2. You must create a symbolic link from the required pymol-ext
directory to the "ext" directory in pymol.  "pymol-ext" should not be
installed within the pymol directory tree if you plan up performing CVS
updates of pymol in the future (which I hope you do).

	ln -s $HOME/pymol-ext $HOME/pymol/ext

3. After you've compiled all of the needed external dependencies, you
need to edit Rules.make and choose options appropriate for your
configuration (here's where knowledge experience is crucial)
	cd $HOME/pymol
	vi ./Rules.make

4. "make" to compile.  A "pymol" binary will be created in this directory.
	cd $HOME/pymol
	make

5. Edit "pymol.csh" to point to appropriate locations on your system
	cd $HOME/pymol
	vi ./pymol.csh

6. source "pymol.csh" from a csh command line in order to set the
appropriate environment variables.  If you're going to use pymol a lot,
add this file to your .cshrc login script
	cd $HOME/pymol
	source pymol.csh

7. You should be all set to run pymol.
	pymol


NOTE: If you ever want to clean up the tree
	"make clean" gets rid of all intermediate objects, etc.
	"make realclean" restores the tree to "distribution" quality
