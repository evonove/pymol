INSTALLATION VIA COMPILATION 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are now two approaches for building PyMOL from source:

   1. Using Python Distutils, so that PyMOL gets installed in the 
      Python library directory (without source code).

   2. Using standard Makefiles, so that PyMOL remains standalone, and
      is based out of the current directory (with source code). 

Approach 1 is recommended if:

  (A) you only want to use a single copy of PyMOL, or

  (B) you don't plan on doing any PyMOL development, or

  (C) you are packaging PyMOL for a standard distribution, or

  (D) you are building on Windows using either Cygwin or Visual C.

Approach 2 is recommended if:

  (A) you want to keep your Python installation free of PyMOL, or

  (B) you plan on doing PyMOL development and need both fast/partial
      recompiles, debugging support, and careful build control, or

  (C) you want to maintain multiple functioning versions of PyMOL
      on a single system.

To use Approach 1:

   You must have OpenGL, glut, libpng, tcl/tk, python, freetype2, and
   Pmw already installed on your system for this to work.

   python setup.py install
   python setup2.py install
   ./pymol

To use Approach 2:

   consult "INSTALL.generic" in the "setup" folder.

Good luck!
