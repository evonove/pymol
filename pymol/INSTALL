INSTALLATION

WARNING: You'll need some basic knowledge of Makefiles, compilation
flags, libraries, python, environment variables, and paths in order to
compile PyMOL.  If you don't have this experience, save yourself
frustration and wait until binaries are available for download.  

1. The "pymol-ext" CVS source tree is required, but only needs to 
be downloaded once.  You must compile all external dependendencies
before trying to compile pymol

Hopefully we can soon replace the pymol-ext source code with a set of
precompiled binary libraries for various platforms.  

2. You must create a symbolic link from the pymol-ext
directory to the "ext" directory in pymol.  "pymol-ext" should not be
installed within the pymol directory tree if you plan up performing CVS
updates of pymol in the future (which I hope you do).
	ln -s $HOME/pymol-ext $HOME/pymol/ext
   (to make all the external expendencies: cd $HOME/pymol-ext; make )

3. After you've compiled all of the needed external dependencies, copy
Rules.<platform> to Rules.make and choose options appropriate for your
configuration (here is where experience counts)
	cd $HOME/pymol
	vi ./Rules.make

4. "make" to compile.  
	cd $HOME/pymol
	make

5. APPROACH 1: (recommended)
  
 If you are making pymol as a Python module, edit pymol.com to
 point to appropriate locations on your system...
	cd $HOME/pymol
	vi ./pymol.com
	
 You should be all set to run pymol.
	pymol.com

NOTE: If you ever want to clean up the tree
	"make clean" gets rid of all intermediate objects, etc.
	"make distclean" restores the tree to "distribution" quality

5. APPROACH 2: (not recommended)

 If you opted to make pymol as a standalone application...(LINUX ONLY)

 Edit "pymol.csh" to point to appropriate locations on your system
	cd $HOME/pymol
	vi ./pymol.csh

 source "pymol.csh" from a csh command line in order to set the
 appropriate environment variables.  If you're going to use pymol a lot,
 add this file to your .cshrc login script
	cd $HOME/pymol
	source pymol.csh

 You should be all set to run pymol.
	pymol.exe
