INSTALLATION AND COMPILATION GUIDE

NOTE: The PyMOL compilation process has changed as of October 2002,
and may have some bugs.  Please help us quash them!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are now approaches for building PyMOL from source:

   1. Using Python Distutils, so that PyMOL gets installed in the 
      Python library directory (without source code).

   2. Using standard Makefiles, so that PyMOL remains standalone, and
      is based out of the current directory (with source code).

Approach 1 is recommended if:

  (A) you only want to use a single copy of PyMOL, or

  (B) you don't plan on doing any PyMOL development, or

  (C) you are packaging PyMOL for distribution.

Approach 2 is recommended if:

  (A) you want to keep your Python installation free of PyMOL, or

  (B) you plan on doing PyMOL development, or

  (C) you want to maintain multiple functioning versions of PyMOL
      on a single system.

To use Approach 1:

   You must have OpenGL, glut, libpng, tcl, python, and Pmw already
   installed on your system for this to work.

   python setup.py install
   python setup2.py
   ./pymol.com

To use Approach 2:

   consult the "INSTALL.generic" instructions in the "setup" folder.

Good luck!
