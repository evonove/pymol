INSTALLATION VIA COMPILATION 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is currently only one *supported* approach for building and
installing PyMOL from the open-source code: via Python Disutils.

You must have OpenGL, glut, libpng, tcl/tk, python, freetype2, and Pmw
already installed on your system for this to work.

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install 
    python setup2.py install
    ./pymol

Good luck!

PS. There are two other *unsupported* approaches intended primarily
for developer use, with pymol runningly directly out of the source
directory instead of being installed into an external Python or the
global system Python.

  1. GNU autotools: assumes that all of the external dependencies are
     already installed in your system.  NOTE: 'make install' only
     targets the local "built" directory.  This build approach is not
     currently intended for a Python-integrated installation --
     see the above distutils approach for that -- but it could be quite
     useful in situations where you want to build and maintain multiple
     PyMOL versions on a single machine, either locally, or system-wide.

    ./configure
    make install
    ./pymol
    make clean (optional, to save space)

  2. DeLano Scientific LLC's internal Makefiles (PROPRIETARY/AS IS):
     assumes that external depencies are already compiled and present
     in the local ./ext subdirectory.
    
    cp setup/Rules.xxxxx Rules.delci # (then configure manually)
    make -f Makefile.delsci
    ./setup/setup.sh
    ./pymol
