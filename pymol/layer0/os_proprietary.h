/* PROPRIETARY CODE SEGMENT DISCLAIMER:
 *
 * DeLano Scientific LLC supports compilation of open-source PyMOL
 * source code on open-source operating systems with open-source
 * development tools.
 *
 * We do not support, nor do we necessarily preclude, compilation
 * of our open-source PyMOL source code on proprietary operating
 * systems such as Microsoft Windows using proprietary development
 * tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio.  Such activities are simply
 * beyond the scope of the PyMOL Open-Source Project as we define it.
 *
 * We deem compilation of PyMOL source code on proprietary platforms
 * to be a proprietary business matter that serves as a robust logical
 * foundation for productive business relationships with mutual and
 * defined benefits.  In other words, if you depend on PyMOL to run
 * well on proprietary operating systems, then it is generally in your
 * interest to engage our business on business terms, such as via paid
 * software licenses, development partnerships, or joint ventures.
 *
 * However, if you still feel that you must compile open-source PyMOL
 * source code on proprietary operating systems, then we suggest use
 * of Linux-like tools and environments, such as Red Hat's Cygwin on
 * Windows and X11/Fink on Mac OS X, since they provide for the
 * greatest compatibility with open-source PyMOL.  Use of our
 * proprietary code segments should be avoided whenever possible.
 *
 * THE FOLLOWING CODE SEGMENT AND ALL OTHERS MARKED "PROPRIETARY" ARE
 * PROVIDED AS IS AND FOR USE AT YOUR OWN RISK WITH NO ASSURANCES OF
 * FUTURE FUNCTION OR AVAILABILITY.  WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO
 * NOT RELY UPON SUCH CODE SEGMENTS SINCE THEY MAY BE ALTERED OR
 * REMOVED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT NOTICE OF ANY KIND.  WARREN LYFORD
 * DELANO AND DELANO SCIENTIFIC LLC DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH
 * REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 * MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.  IN NO EVENT SHALL WARREN LYFORD
 * DELANO OR DELANO SCIENTIFIC LLC BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT
 * OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM
 * LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
 * NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN
 * CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
