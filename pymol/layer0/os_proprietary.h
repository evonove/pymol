/* PROPRIETARY CODE SEGMENT DISCLAIMER:
 *
 * DeLano Scientific LLC supports and strongly encourages compilation
 * of open-source PyMOL source code on open-source operating systems
 * with open-source development tools (e.g. Linux/XFree86 with GCC).
 *
 * We do not support, nor do we necessarily preclude, compilation
 * of our open-source PyMOL source code on proprietary operating
 * systems such as Microsoft Windows using proprietary development
 * tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio.  Such activities are simply
 * beyond the scope of the PyMOL Open-Source Project as we define it.
 *
 * We deem compilation of PyMOL source code on proprietary platforms
 * to be a proprietary business matter that serves as a robust logical
 * foundation for productive business relationships with mutual and
 * defined benefits.  In other words, if you depend on PyMOL to run
 * well on proprietary operating systems, then we maintain that it is
 * in your interest to engage our business on business terms, such as
 * through paid software subscriptions and licenses, through software
 * development partnerships, or by launching joint business ventures.
 *
 * If, however, you still feel that you must compile open-source PyMOL
 * source code on proprietary operating systems, then we suggest use
 * of Linux-like tools and environments, such as Red Hat's Cygwin on
 * Windows and X11/GCC/Fink on Mac OS X, since they will provide for
 * the greatest compatibility and synergy with the Open-Source PyMOL
 * project.  Regardless of the approach you choose, use of and
 * reliance upon our proprietary code segments should be avoided
 * wherever and whenever possible.
 *
 * THE FOLLOWING CODE SEGMENT AND ALL OTHERS MARKED "PROPRIETARY" ARE
 * PROVIDED AS IS AND FOR USE AT YOUR OWN RISK WITH NO ASSURANCES OF
 * FUTURE FUNCTION OR AVAILABILITY.  WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO
 * NOT RELY UPON PROPRIETARY CODE SEGMENTS SINCE THEY MAY BE ALTERED
 * OR REMOVED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT NOTICE OF ANY KIND.  WARREN
 * LYFORD DELANO AND DELANO SCIENTIFIC LLC DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES
 * WITH REGARD TO PROPRIETARY CODE SEGMENTS, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED
 * WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.  IN NO EVENT SHALL
 * WARREN LYFORD DELANO OR DELANO SCIENTIFIC LLC BE LIABLE FOR ANY
 * SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES
 * WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN
 * AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF PROPRIETARY
 * CODE SEGMENTS.
