/* PROPRIETARY CODE SEGMENT DISCLAIMER:
 *
 * DeLano Scientific LLC supports and strongly encourages compilation
 * of open-source PyMOL source code on open-source operating systems
 * with open-source development tools (e.g. Linux/XFree86 with GCC
 * using Python's distutils or perhaps the GNU Build System).
 *
 * We do not support, but nor do we necessarily preclude, compilation
 * of open-source PyMOL source code on proprietary operating systems
 * such as Microsoft Windows using proprietary development tools such
 * as Microsoft Visual Studio.  Such activities are simply beyond the
 * scope of the PyMOL Open-Source Project as we choose to define it.
 *
 * Please note that we generally view compilation of PyMOL source code
 * on proprietary platforms as the obvious and logical foundation for
 * productive business relationships with defined and mutual benefits.
 * In other words, if you depend on PyMOL to run well on proprietary
 * operating systems, then it is in your interest to engage our
 * business on business-like terms, such as through paid software
 * subscriptions and licenses, through software development
 * partnerships, or by participating in collaborations and joint
 * ventures. 
 *
 * If, however, you still feel that you absolutely must compile
 * open-source PyMOL source code on proprietary operating systems,
 * then we suggest use of Linux-like tools and environments, such as
 * Red Hat's Cygwin on Windows and X11/GCC/Fink on Mac OS X, since
 * those tools will provide the greatest compatibility and synergy
 * with the Open-Source PyMOL project.  Regardless of the approach you
 * choose, usage of and reliance upon marked proprietary code segments
 * should be avoided wherever and whenever possible.
 *
 * THE FOLLOWING CODE SEGMENT AND ALL OTHERS MARKED "PROPRIETARY" ARE
 * PROVIDED AS IS AND FOR USE AT YOUR OWN RISK WITH NO ASSURANCES OF
 * FUTURE FUNCTION OR AVAILABILITY.  WE STRONGLY CAUTION THAT YOU DO
 * NOT RELY UPON PROPRIETARY CODE SEGMENTS SINCE THEY MAY BE ALTERED
 * OR REMOVED AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT NOTICE OF ANY KIND.  WARREN
 * LYFORD DELANO AND DELANO SCIENTIFIC LLC DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES
 * WITH REGARD TO PROPRIETARY CODE SEGMENTS, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED
 * WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.  IN NO EVENT SHALL
 * WARREN LYFORD DELANO OR DELANO SCIENTIFIC LLC BE LIABLE FOR ANY
 * SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES
 * WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN
 * AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING
 * OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF PROPRIETARY
 * CODE SEGMENTS.
