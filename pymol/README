PyMOL is an OPEN SOURCE program distributed under the "Python" license.
Please see the LICENSE file for additional information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
See INSTALL for installation instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PyMOL has the following external dependencies:
  1. OpenGL
  2. GLUT library for OpenGL
  3. Python (v 1.5.2 or better) compiled WITH thread support
  4. libpng (can compiled without it, but image saves won't work)
  5. Tcl/Tk (technically optional)
  6. Numerical Python (technically optional)
  7. Python megawidgets (Pmw -- only required for the "external" GUI)

Specific Acknowledgments:

* Thanks to Aaron Miller (GlaxoSmithKline) for a continuous stream of
  thoughful opinions and suggestions.

* Thanks to Dave Weininger for being an ordinary friend at just the
  right time.

* Thanks to Mick Savage for experienced practical advice.

* Thanks to Ian Matthew for outside experience and information.

* Thanks for Jeff Blaney for numerous insightful discussions.

* Thanks to Elizabeth Pehrson for making this a team effort.

* Thanks to Erin Bradley for schooling in focus and vision.

* Thanks to Vera Povolona for catalytic clarity and introspection.

* Thanks to Anthony Nichols for proving that it can be done, yet again.

* Thanks to Thompson Doman for timely Open-Source validation.

* Thanks to Manfred Sippl for making it all seem so simple.

* Thanks to Kristian Rother for all his excellent work building on the
  PyMOL foundation, and in helping others learn to use the software.

* Thanks to Dave Weininger, Scott Dixon, Roger Sayle, Andrew Dalke, 
  Anthony Nichols, Dick Cramer, and David Miller, as well as rest of 
  the Daylight and OpenEye teams for thoughtful discussions on PyMOL
  and open-source software during my 2002 pilgrimage to Sante Fe, NM.

* Thanks to Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve for his contribution of the "sglite"
  space group and symmetry handling module.

* Thanks to the scientists and management of Sunesis Pharmaceuticals 
  for supporting PyMOL development since its inception.

* Thanks to the Computational Crystallography Initiative (LBNL) 
  developers for their encouragement, ideas, and support. 

* Thanks to Scott Walsh for being the first individual to provide 
  financial support for PyMOL.  

* Thanks to the anonymous pharmacetical companies who have provided 
  financial support for hardware and development expenses (you know
  who you are!).

* Thanks to Brian Paul and the Precision Insight team for development
  of Mesa/DRI which greatly assisted in the early development of PyMOL.

* Thanks to Michael Love for the first major outside port of PyMOL
  (to GNU-Darwin/OSX) and for believing in the cause.  

* Thanks for Paul Sherwood for making a concerted effort to develop 
  using PyMOL long before the software and vision had matured.

* Thanks to Jay Ponder for thoughtful email discussions on Tinker and
  the role of open-source scientific software.

* Thanks to hundreds of PyMOL users for the many forms of feedback,
  bug sightings, and encouragement they've provided.
