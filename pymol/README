PyMOL has the following external dependencies:
  1. OpenGL
  2. GLUT library for OpenGL
  3. Python (v 1.5.2 or better) compiled WITH thread support
  4. libpng (can compiled without it, but image saves won't work)
  5. Tcl/Tk (technically optional)
  6. Numerical Python (technically optional)
  7. Python megawidgets (Pmw)

Specific Acknowledgments:

* Thanks to Ralf Grosse-Kunstleve for his contribution of the "sglite"
space group and symmetry handling module.

* Thanks to the scientists and management of Sunesis Pharmaceuticals 
for supporting PyMOL development since its inception.

* Thanks to the Computational Crystallography Initiative developers
for their encouragement, ideas, and support. 

* Thanks to Brian Paul and the Precision Insight team for development
of Mesa/DRI which greatly assisted in the early development of PyMOL.

* Thanks to Michael Love for the first major outside port of PyMOL
(to GNU-Darwin/OSX) and for believing in the cause.

* Thanks for Paul Sherwood for making a concerted effort to develop 
using PyMOL long before the software and vision had matured.

* Thanks to hundreds of PyMOL users for the many forms of feedback,
bug sightings, and encouragement they've provided.
