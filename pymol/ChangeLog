      However, if changed to a non-zero value, they will take priority.                     
                                                                                            
      This behavior provides better WYSIWYG for raytracing, but will break                  
      some scripts.                                                                         
                                                                                            
    * fixed map_new ...,gaussian,... command and added options                              
          gaussian_resolution

          gaussion_b_floor                                                                  
       default "map_new name" now creates a 2 A electron density map using                  
       current atomic Q and B for direct comparison with experimental density               
                                                                                            
    * updated ray tracer to support edge oversampling -- Antialiased rendering              
      is now SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER for simple scenes and is now enabled by                   
      default. Full scene supersampling is no longer necessary in most cases, but           
      if activated, it will provide even better image quality.                              
                                                                                            
      Antialias setting can now have values of 0-4:                                         
        antialias 0: no antialiasing                                                        
        antialias 1: edge-oversampling (as per ray_oversample_cutoff)                       
        antialias 2: 2X full scene supersample plus edge oversampling                       
        antialias 3: 3X full scene supersample plus edge oversampling                       
        antialias 4: 4X full scene supersample plus edge oversampling                       
                                                                                            
    * restored CRLFs on Windows versions of PyMOL so that                                   
      python code can be viewed/edited with Notepad, etc.

    * better support for Python in PyMOL command scripts ('\' works for multiline blocks).  
                                                                                            
    * freeze state and thaw state added to mol_action menu                                  
                                                                                            
    * added xmlrpc01.py demonstration program to examples/devel

    * fixed handling of calcium atoms                                                       
                                                                                            
    * added automatic scroll bar for when you get too many objects/selections               
                                                                                            
    * added handle to manually adjust internal gui width                                    
                                                                                            
    * updated OpenGL depth_cue setting to more closely match those of raytracer             
                                                                                            
    * "center" command                                                                      
                                                                                            
    * PyMOL no longer wraps output lines by default "set wrap_output=78"                    
      to get previous behavior                                                              
                                                                                            
    * relocated binary shared objects from modules into the modules/pymol                   
      tree                                                                                  
                                                                                            
    * data files now separated from the modules directory into a parallel data              
      tree in $PYMOL_PATH                                                                   
                                                                                            
    * added ability to build PyMOL using Python distutils                                   
                                                                                            
    * revamped the PyMOL launch process.  It should now be possible                         
      to launch pymol simply with an "import pymol" statement, provided                     
      that the modules are in the Python search path                                        
                                                                                            
    * fixed get_dihedral to use current state index                                         
                                                                                            
    * revamped smooth command and added documentation                                       
                                                                                            
    * added some nasty code to handle quotes and apostrophes in atom selections             
      so that nucleic acids and sugars with apostrophes will work right while               
      you can also still explicitly use apostrophes or quotes                               
                                                                                            
    * added "safe" option to zoom command in order to provide a mode                        
      which will guarantee against clipping                                                 
                                                                                            
 Changes up to 0.84                                                                         
                                                                                            
    * updated SPHEROID command for use with trajectories                                    
                                                                                            
    * Can now read AMBER topology, coordinate, trajectory, and restart files                
                                                                                            
    * PyMOL now transforms 4-character atom names appropriately by default.                 
      Thus, 3HG2 in PDB file becomes an atom named "HG23"                                   
      If you don't like this, "set pdb_literal_names=1".                                    
                                                                                            
    * PyMOL now preserves stereo field on MOL-files to better enable                        
      shuttling of 2D structures through PyMOL...

    * VDW radii adjusted.  Use "set legacy_vdw_radii=1" on start-up for old values.

    * created stop_on_exception and raise_exceptions settings.                              
      WARNING: stop_on_exceptions is NOT set by default (this is so that                    
      log files which contain errors will continue to function).                            
                                                                                            
    * gutted cmd.py, and created a bunch of sub-modules which contain the                   
      code previously in cmd.py.                                                            
                                                                                            
    * superposition bugs fixed with multi-state objects (fit and intra_fit)                 
                                                                                            
    * cmd.set_key can now be used to redefine ALT and CTRL keys in addition                 
      to function keys and other specials.

    * fixed triangle rendering on lower-end graphics cards                                  
                                                                                            
    * revamped PyMOL's internal bond handling data structure.  I've done my best            
      to insure that this doesn't break anything, but it is a major change                  
      and has the potential to create huge problems...

    * HETATMS are no longer surfaced by default.  Clear the "ignore" flag or                
      set surface_mode=1 to restore their surfaces.                                         
                                                                                            
    * flag command now takes name arguments and can now reset, set, and clear               
      flags

    * Upgrading OpenGL Pop-up menus, since it looks like the internal GUI                   
      will be widely used despite its original limited role (oh well...)

    * added ray_improve_shadows setting for improving shadows by                            
      projecting outward from triangles.

      on surfaces                                                                           
                                                                                            
    * Fixed a huge bug in surfacing of subsets. That function was totally whacked,          
      but no one had noticed or complained!!!  Revised the function of the                  
      surface_proximity setting                                                             
                                                                                            
    *  by default, PDB HETATMs are no longer surfaced -- if you want them to be, then       
       please "set surface_mode=1"                                                          
                                                                                            
    * "transparent" renamed to "transparency"                                               
                                                                                            
    * switched to a three-pass OpenGL rendering model in order to properly display opaque,

    * stage 1 API enhancements -- consistent return conventions adopted                     
      (many will not follow conventions until stage 2 though)

    * LOG FILE CAPABILITIES:  logging of both PyMOL scripts (.pml) and                      
      PyMOL program files (.pym). The "resume" command allows propagation                   
      of session-like behavior.  This makes a huge difference in PyMOL                      
      user-friendliness.

    * selection language now supports '+' as substitute for commas, and '-'                 
      as substitute for ':' in residue identifiers (more user friendly)

       never be carried out -- they are listed here so that we don't                        
       forget about them and so that you can see ways in which core PyMOL                   
       might evolve.

         integration of basic force-field structures into PyMOL...not a                     
         lightweight task, but something I think should be done in a                        
         general way to facilitate use of PyMOL as a molecular modeling

       * fold MMTK into the main PyMOL distribution, and merge the two                      
         programs in a way which allow the user to "see" into MMTK's                        
         internal data structures using PyMOL while calculations are
