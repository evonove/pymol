# Here is how to build PyMOL for RedHat 7x with installation in:
#
# "/usr/local/pymol"
#
# Step 1: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.

rpm -q python
rpm -q tcl
rpm -q tk
rpm -q libpng
rpm -q zlib
rpm -q Mesa-devel

# Step 2: Extract the PyMOL archive and change to that directory.

cd /usr/local/pymol

# Step 3: Copy the appropriate makefile rules to "Rules.make".

cp Rules.linux-rh7x Rules.make

# Step 4: Build PyMOL.

make

# Step 5: You probably don't have Pmw, so install the PyMOL copy.

make pmw

# Step 6: Create you own copy of the start-up script.

cp pymol.com.linux-rh7x pymol.com

# Step 7: Test it.

./pymol.com

# Step 8: (optional) Make PyMOL available to all users.

ln -s /usr/local/pymol/pymol.com /usr/local/bin/pymol

#######

# If you'd like to put PyMOL somewhere else, then change the paths in
# "Rules.make" and "pymol.com" prior to compilation.
