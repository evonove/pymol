PyMOL>help def

DESCRIPTION

    You have asked for help on a Python keyword which is available
    from within the PyMOL command language.  Please consult the
    official Python documentation at http://www.python.org for
    detailed information on Python keywords.

    You may include Python blocks in your PyMOL command scripts, but do
    note that multi-line blocks of Python in PyMOL command files will
    require explicit continuation syntax in order to execute properly
    (see below).

    Generally, if you want to write Python block which span multiple
    lines, you will want to use ".py" file, and then use "extend" in
    order to expose your new code to the PyMOL command language.  This
    will give you better error checking and more predictable results.

EXAMPLES

    a=1
    while a<10: \
        print a \
        a=a+1
