Major progress in the last week! Added solid surfaces to the
representations and triangle rendering to the ray tracer.  

Current TODO list:
	
On surfaces:
	1. replace GL_TRIANGLES with GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP for better performance
	2. associate vertices with atoms
	3. color vertices, but also optimize for uniform coloring

On meshes:
	1. associate vertices with atoms
	2. support mesh coloring, but optimize for uniform coloring

On selections:
	1. support attribute selection
	2. optimize "around and expand"
