Major progress in the last week! Added solid surfaces to the
available representations and triangle rendering to the ray tracer.  

Current TODO list:
	
On selections:
	1. support attribute selection
	2. optimize "around and expand"

Put up a gallery page on the web site with a dozen images
and half a dozen movies.
