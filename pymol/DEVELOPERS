PyMOL Developer Notice
======================

There are three ways in which you can contribute to the 
PyMOL Molecular Graphics Project as a developer.

(1) Work on the main source tree.  As a simple matter of practicality,
you must also transfer copyright of such changes to DeLano Scientific
and attach no conditions to your work beyond those specified in the
PyMOL LICENSE file.  Essentially you are giving everyone the right to
use your code for all purposes without restriction.  This is core to
the PyMOL open-source philosophy, and no exceptions will be made. 

(2) Develop self-contained functionality that can become part of the
contrib directory.  Here you can retain your own copyright to your
code, but you must still make the donation under the "Python" license
or an equivalent.  Again, you must give everyone the right to use your
code for all purposes without restriction, and there will be no
exceptions.

(3) Develop independent functionality which makes use of the PyMOL
Python API.  Here your code need not become part of the PyMOL
distribution, and you can attach whatever restrictions you would like
to usage of your code.  However, if you want your code to become part
of the official PyMOL distribution, you will need to release it under
the "Python" license or an equivalent.

These are draft rules.  I'd appreciate any feedback and comments
(email to warren@delanoscientific.com).  However, I am absolutely
opposed to restricting PyMOL to GPL, so don't even ask.  Contrary to
Richard Stallman and the "Free" Software Foundation
(http://www.fsf.org), I believe that the open-source movement will
benefit from source code with fewer restrictions, not more!

PyMOL, like Python, is truly free and open-source.
