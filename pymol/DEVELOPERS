PyMOL Developer Notice
======================

There are three ways in which software developers can contribute to
the PyMOL Molecular Graphics Project.

(1) Work on the main source tree.  As a matter of simple practicality,
you must transfer copyright of such improvements to DeLano Scientific
and attach no conditions to your work beyond those specified in the
PyMOL LICENSE file.  Essentially you are giving everyone the right to
use your code for all purposes without restriction.  This is core to
the PyMOL open-source philosophy, so don't ask for exceptions.

(2) Develop self-contained functionality that can be integrated into
PyMOL as part of the "contrib" directory.  With this approach, you
retain copyright to your code, but you must still place your source
under the "Python" license or an equivalent.  Again, you are giving
everyone the right to use your code for all purposes without
restriction, no exceptions.

(3) Develop independent functionality which makes use of the PyMOL
Python API.  With this approach, your project need not become part of
the PyMOL distribution, and you can attach whatever restrictions you
would like to usage and distribution of your code.  However, if you
attach restrictions, then you must also assume responsibility for
distributing the software.  If you want your code to become part of
the official PyMOL package, then you will need to release it under the
"Python" license or an equivalent non-restrictive open source license
(not GPL).

All contributors to the PyMOL project who donate source code will be
permanently acknowledged by name in the individual source files and in
the main PyMOL README file (unless they request otherwise).  E-mail
addresses will only be included upon request.  Major contributors will
be acknowledged on the initial "splash" screen as space permits.
Self-contained packages for the contrib directory should contain
separate LICENSE statements and copyright notices.

These are draft rules, and I would appreciate feedback and comments
(email to warren@delanoscientific.com).  However, I will not consider
contaminating Open-Source PyMOL with the GNU Public License (GPL).
