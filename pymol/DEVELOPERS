PyMOL Developer Notice
======================

Updated January 28th, 2006

There are three ways in which software developers can contribute to
the PyMOL Molecular Graphics Project.

(1) Work on the main source tree.  As a practical matter, you must
transfer copyright of such improvements to Schrodinger, LLC and
attach no conditions to your work beyond those specified in the PyMOL
LICENSE file.  Essentially you are giving everyone the right to use
your code for all purposes without restriction.  To explicitly
transfer ownership to us or to place it in the public domain, include
the appropriate headers below at the top of each source code file.

/* On January 28th, 2006, I, John Doe, hereby transfer copyright and
 * assign all rights, title, and interest in the following source code to
 * DeLano Scientific LLC. */
 
/* On January 28th, 2006, I, John Doe, hereby place the following
 * source code into the public domain. */

(2) Develop self-contained functionality that can be integrated into
PyMOL as part of the "contrib" directory.  With this approach, you
retain copyright to your code, but you must still place your source
under the "Python" license or an equivalent.  Again, you are giving
everyone the right to use your code for all purposes without
restriction, no exceptions.  Source code header:

/*
____module name_____ Copyright Notice 
=====================================

The ____module name____ source code is copyrighted, but you can freely
use and copy it as long as you don't change or remove any of the
Copyright notices.  ____module name____ is made available under the
following open-source license terms:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
______module name_____ is Copyright (C) 2006 ____your name____

                        All Rights Reserved

Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute, and distribute modified
versions of this software and its built-in documentation for any
purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above
copyright notice appears in all copies and that both the copyright
notice and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation,
and that the names of ____your name and company (if any)____ not be
used in advertising or publicity pertaining to distribution of the
software without specific, written prior permission.

____your name and company (if any)____ DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH
REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF
USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR
PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*/

(3) Develop independent functionality which makes use of the PyMOL
Python API.  With this approach, your project need not become part of
the PyMOL distribution, and you can attach whatever restrictions you
would like to usage and distribution of your code.  However, if you
attach restrictions, then you must also assume responsibility for
distributing the software.  If you want your code to become part of
the official PyMOL package, then you will need to release it under the
"PyMOL" license or an equivalent non-restrictive open source license
(not GPL).

Thanks for your participation in the PyMOL Open-Source Project!
