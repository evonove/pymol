This directory contains a set of scripts which demonstrate
how to launch PyMOL from within Python (if PyMOL has been built
as a module).

To use them, the appropriate pymol module directories must already
be in your Python search path (pymol, chempy, pmg_tk, Pmw), and 
the PYMOL_PATH environment variable must be set.  

For example, under csh on unix:

setenv PYMOL_PATH $HOME/pymol
setenv PYTHONPATH $PYMOL_PATH/modules
python launch.py

NOTE: It may sometimes be necessary to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you
have built the external dependencies separately.
