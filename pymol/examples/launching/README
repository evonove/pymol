This directory contains a set of scripts which demonstrate
how to launch PyMOL from within Python (if PyMOL has been built
as a module).

To use them, the appropriate pymol module directories must already
be in your Python search path (pymol, chempy, pmg_tk, Pmw) and 
PYMOL_PATH must be set.

For example, under csh:

setenv PYMOL_PATH $HOME/pymol
setenv PYTHONPATH $PYMOL_PATH/modules
python launch.py
