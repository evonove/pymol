# This is an example of firing up PyMOL inside of a subordinate
# process via an "import pymol"
# 
# NOTE: for this to work, PyMOL must be installed in a
# Python-dependent fashion (e.g. pymol-0_98-bin-win32-py23) etc.
#
# WARNING: stability issues have been known to occur with this
# approach, so anticipate problems...take-down is messy.
#
# WARNING: Right now, there is no way for the main process to know
# when PyMOL is actually initialized and ready to go, so we simply
# sleep a second after importing.
