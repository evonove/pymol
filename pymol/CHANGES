Changes Under Consideration

NOTE: Some of these are mutually exclusive, and many of them will
never be carried out -- they are listed here so that I don't forget
about them and so that you can see ways in which core PyMOL might
evolve.

   * Allow multiple, parallel transformation matrices for each object 

   * Create a Rasmol translator in Python

   * IO routine for a generic volume data object (to supplement bricks and maps)

   * Support mapping of additional dimensions into volume data sets
     for use in coloring all PyMOL geometries according to electrostatic
     potential and the like.

   * "Fragment" wizard, tied into the fragments subsystem. 

   * "Batchmin" wizard ?

   * Real Edit Menu in Tk

   * CTRL and CTRL/SHIFT numbers should add aromatic and aliphatic
     ring systems in the builder respectively within the molecular editor.

   * support anisotropic B-factor renditions (ellipsoids)

   * support reading and writing of XPLOR PSF/PDB files to enable direct
     use of NAMD with PyMOL.  Note that this will require integration of
     basic force-field structures into PyMOL...not a lightweight task, but
     something I think should be done in a general way to facilitate
     use of PyMOL as a molecular modeling tool...

   * support direct reading of DCD, and/or Gromacs trajectory files

   * support MOL2 and multi-MOL2 file formats

   * fold MMTK into the main PyMOL distribution, and merge the two programs in a way
     which allow the user to "see" into MMTK's internal data structures using
     PyMOL while calculations are being performed.

   * create a VRML->CGO converter so that VRML can be displayed inside of PyMOL

   * create a VRML writer to facilitate export of PyMOL geometries.

   * support CML via some "swallowable" python XML parser
 
   * add in support for CGL's annotated PDB file format

   * make PyMOL a compliant extension for the Chimera environment

   * add a dynamic 3-D based tutorial

   * finish abstracting GLUT away from PyMOL and wrap it inside of TOGL so that
     Chimera and PyMOL can share a context 

Specific Requests from Users

   * Solid clipped spheres and surfaces (how?)

   * Completely black/opaque underside of surfaces

   * Get label support into the raytracer (build a 3D character set)

   * Enable specific xyz positioning of labels (w/ mouse?)
   
   * Cutting of images to the MS Window's clipboard for easy pasting into Powerpoint

Current and Ongoing Goals

   * make an ActiveX control which contains the core PyMOL viewer for 
     use in web browsers and many other crazy contexts.

   * clean up return values in the API and qualify exceptions.  Include the source
     module name in messages, and provide proper feedback conditionals

   * update 'expand' and 'attach' to take an atom name as well as an element symbol

   * complete first-round test-cases.

   * complete matrix-based object translation and rotation

   * place feedback conditionals around all error output.

   * create alter_state_atom command (combine PAlter and PAlterState into one function)

Main Goals for 1.0 Release

   * MOL2 and CML file formats

   * Generalized volumetric rendering: (1) mesh (2) solid (3) colormaps

   * Integrated tutorial/demonstration system

   * Fully consistent API (defined and correct return values)

Current Bugs to Fix

   * superposition system fails with degenerate sets (planer systems, etc).
     sometimes it just fails period

In Progress

   * real session saves nearing completion...

Changes up to 0.85

     tree

   * data files now separated from the modules directory into a parallel data
     tree in $PYMOL_PATH

   * added ability to build PyMOL using Python distutils
   
   * revamped the PyMOL launch process.  It should now be possible
     to launch pymol simply with an "import pymol" statement, provided
     that the modules are in the Python search path

   * fixed get_dihedral to use current state index

   * revamped smooth command and added documentation

   * added some nasty code to handle quotes and apostrophes in atom selections
     so that nucleic acids and sugars with apostrophes will work right while
     you can also still explicitly use apostrophes or quotes

     which will guarantee against clipping

Changes up to 0.84

   * updated SPHEROID command for use with trajectories

   * Can now read AMBER topology, coordinate, trajectory, and restart files

   * PyMOL now transforms 4-character atom names appropriately by default.
     Thus, 3HG2 in PDB file becomes an atom named "HG23"
     If you don't like this, "set pdb_literal_names=1".

   * PyMOL now preserves stereo field on MOL-files to better enable
     shuttling of 2D structures through PyMOL...

   * fixed bug in startup file reading

   * first inclusion of cex file support

Changes up to 0.82

   * WARNING: default behavior of isomesh and isosurf changed!  By default, they

   * transparent spheres

Changes up to 0.75

   * enabled automatic completion in the tcl/tk command window

   * altered settings for dot representation

   * created stop_on_exception and raise_exceptions settings.
     WARNING: stop_on_exceptions is NOT set by default (this is so that
     log files which contain errors will continue to function).

   * gutted cmd.py, and created a bunch of sub-modules which contain the
     code previously in cmd.py.  
   
   * superposition bugs fixed with multi-state objects (fit and intra_fit)

   * fixed triangle rendering on lower-end graphics cards

   * revamped PyMOL's internal bond handling data structure.  I've done my best

   * flag command now takes name arguments and can now reset, set, and clear 
     flags

   * established some standard flag names and conventions

   * Upgrading OpenGL Pop-up menus, since it looks like the internal GUI
     will be widely used despite its original limited role (oh well...)

   * Fixed element name guessing

     projecting outward from triangles.

   * Fixed a major bug in the raytracer which was causing bogus shadows to appear
     on surfaces

     but no one had noticed or complained!!!  Revised the function of the 
     surface_proximity setting

   *  by default, PDB HETATMs are no longer surfaced -- if you want them to be, then
      please "set surface_mode=1"

   * "transparent" renamed to "transparency"

   * more surface_qualities: -3 to 2, surface_quality=1 is now even better

   * click-and-drag a box to select atoms

   * PyMOL now builds w/o warning in VC++6

   * LOG FILE CAPABILITIES:  logging of both PyMOL scripts (.pml) and
     PyMOL program files (.pym). The "resume" command allows propagation
     of session-like behavior.  This makes a huge difference in PyMOL
     user-friendliness.

     definition of ribbons...
