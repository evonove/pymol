Potential Changes

   * Transparency support. 

   * Specular lighting option under GL

   * Auto-detection of stereo capability

   * Generic volume data object (to supplement bricks and maps)

Impending Changes

   * Reimplmentation of the Settings subsystem to support object-
   specific settings, direct access to setting from Python, and
   complete browsing and access to internal settings from a GUI.

   * Tuning-up of the Tk-based GUI

   * Tracking down thread-related hangs upon program termination
   
Changes up to 0.50

   * alias and extend commands

   * Additional test cases.

   * Parser improved with a new argument parsing subsystem which has a
   better mapping to standard Python arguments.  This has significant
   potential to break existing code if there are any bugs, but I am
   targeting 100% backward compatibility.  It will now be possible to
   extend the parser to call arbitrary python functions (provided that
   they  can handle/convert from string arguments).

Changes up to 0.49

   * Improved editor, hydrogens now auto-deleted.

   * Visible selections.

   * Default mouse actions changed for editing and atom selecting.

   * Callback objects (for use with PyOpenGL) now have extents.

   * get_state and get_frame API functions

Important Changes 0.42-0.48

   Too numerous to list them all...
   
   * Addition of support for PyOpenGL-based GL calls with callback objects

   * Wizard feature, for grabbing mouse input -- still needs flushing out.
