Changes Under Consideration

   * Transparency support. 

   * Specular lighting option under GL

   * Auto-detection of stereo capability

   * Generic volume data object (to supplement bricks and maps)

   * "Pickable" stick representation

   * Log file generation capability

   * "Builder" wizard, tied into the fragments subsystem.

   * Protein side-chain rotamer wizard.

   * "Tinker" wizard 

Impending Changes

   * Reimplementation of the Settings subsystem to support object-
   specific settings, direct access to setting from Python, and
   complete browsing and access to internal settings from a GUI.

   * Tuning-up of the Tk-based GUI

   * Tracking down thread-related hangs upon program termination
   
   * Saving and restoring matrix, center, origin, zoom, clip

Changes up to 0.50


   * "Distances" wizard (internal gui;replace with external version later)

   * "Pair Fit" wizard (internal gui; replace with external version later)

   * Mesh objects now have states, and new meshes are appended onto the object.

   * Modified raytrace antialiasing transfer function improve contrast.

   * Created alias and extend commands for the parser.

   * Additional test cases.

   * Parser improved with a new argument parsing subsystem which has a
   better mapping to standard Python arguments.  This has significant
   potential to break existing code if there are any bugs, but I am
   the goal is 100% backwards compatibility. 

Changes up to 0.49

   * Improved editor, hydrogens now auto-deleted.

   * Visible selections.

   * Default mouse actions changed for editing and atom selecting.

   * Callback objects (for use with PyOpenGL) now have extents.

   * get_state and get_frame API functions

Important Changes 0.42-0.48

   Too numerous to list them all...
   
   * Addition of support for PyOpenGL-based GL calls with callback objects

   * Wizard feature, for grabbing mouse input -- still needs flushing out.
