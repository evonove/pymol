Changes Under Consideration

   * Transparency support. 

   * Generic volume data object (to supplement bricks and maps)

   * Log file generation capability

   * "Builder" wizard, tied into the fragments subsystem.

   * Protein side-chain rotamer wizard.

   * "Tinker" wizard 

   * Real Edit Menu in Tk

   * draw all solid representations before drawing lines
     in order to improve antialiasing.

Ongoing Goals

   * fill-out object/coord set specific settings

   * clean-up return conventions in cmd.py

   * complete first-round test-cases

   * feedback conditionals placed around all error output

In Progress

   * Mutagenesis wizard

Changes up to 0.56

   * fixed a serious parser bug with the mdo command

Changes up to 0.53

   * change order of drawing within object to improve the
     interaction with antialiased lines.

   * thread safety improvements (fixed bug involving serial 
     manipulations of the same object)

   * bug fix with stick representations

   * fixed minor goof with cmd.dist retval in 0.52

Changes up to 0.52

   * many improvements to online help

   * fixed discrete objects created from PDB files

   * prevented deadlock condition with re-entrant API locks

   * fixed couple of logic-bugs in threading 

   * changed output format from mouse click to a valid selection

   * finished retrofit of the parser.
   
   * formal charge now read from MOL files -- need to consider full
     implementation of MOL file reading capability (incl stereo)

Changes up to 0.51

   * Tcl/Tk GUI now contains a save molecule option

   * Tcl/Tk GUI help improved 

   * performance/quality options in the display menu

   * sphere quality setting
       
   * depth_cue toggle setting (important for low-end PC hardware)
 
   * specular reflections

   * fog setting

Changes up to 0.50

   * can now "pick" C-alphas in the ribbon

   * can now "pick" atoms and bonds in the stick representation 

   * improved clipping plane control command "clip"

   * pym file extension support, for PyMOL-specific .py files

   * better windows NT compatibility

   * settings browser

   * view, view_get, view_set commands

   * Parser now contains a general shortcut handling module to
     further help in reducing typing

   * Slight tweak of the virtual trackball

   * Saving and restoring matrix, center, origin, zoom, clip

   * Internal program output no longer includes python's stderr
   
   * New thread management solution -- simple and stable -- plus 
     it even works (I've even got test cases to prove it)!

   * Fixed memory-trashing bug in the selector

   * Found a workaround for KDE/Gnome/Tkinter/Tcl/Tk problems under linux

   * Created Save option on the Tkinter menu, and added additional file types.

   * TAB-activated filename and command completion (CTRL-D too)

   * Former TAB functionality moved to ESC (text/graphics toggle)

   * Auto-detection of stereo capability

   * Created a robust Feedback control mechanism

   * Eliminated hangs and crashes upon program termination with Win2k/NT.
   
   * "Distances" wizard (internal gui;replace with external version later)

   * "Pair Fit" wizard (internal gui; replace with external version later)

   * Mesh objects now have states, and new meshes are appended.

   * Modified raytrace antialiasing transfer function to improve sharpness.

   * Created alias and extend commands so that python scripts can extend the
   pymol language on the fly.

   * Additional test cases.

   * Parser improved with a new argument parsing subsystem which has a
   better mapping to standard Python arguments.  This has significant
   potential to break existing code if there are any bugs, but I am
   shooting for 100% backwards compatibility. 

Changes up to 0.49

   * Improved editor, hydrogens now auto-deleted.

   * Visible selections.

   * Default mouse actions changed for editing and atom selecting.

   * Callback objects (for use with PyOpenGL) now have extents.

   * get_state and get_frame API functions

Important Changes 0.42-0.48

   Too numerous to list them all...
   
   * Addition of support for PyOpenGL-based GL calls with callback objects

   * Wizard feature, for grabbing mouse input -- still needs flushing out.
