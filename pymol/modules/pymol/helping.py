DESCRIPTION

    You have asked for help on a Python keyword which is available
    from within the PyMOL command language.  Please consult the
    official Python documentation at http://www.python.org for
    detailed information on Python keywords.

    You may include Python blocks in your PyMOL command scripts, but do
    note that multi-line blocks of Python in PyMOL command files will
    require explicit continuation syntax in order to execute properly
    (see below).

    Generally, if you want to write Python block which span multiple
    lines, you will want to use ".py" file, and then use "extend" in
    order to expose your new code to the PyMOL command language.  This
    will give you better error checking and more predictable results.

EXAMPLES

    a=1
    while a<10: \
        print a \
        a=a+1

SUMMARY

PyMOL has a rudimentary, but quite functional molecular structure
editing capability.  However, you will need to use an external mimizer
to "clean-up" your structures after editing.  Furthermore, if you are
going to modify molecules other than proteins, then you will also need
a way of assigning atom types on the fly.

To edit a conformation or structure, you first need to enter editing
mode (see Mouse Menu).  Then you can pick an atom (CTRL-Middle click)
or a bond (CTRL-Right click).  Next, you can use the other
CTRL-key/click combinations listed on the right hand side of the
screen to adjust the attached fragments.  For example, CTRL-left click
will move fragments about the selected torsion.

Editing structures is done through a series of CTRL key actions
applied to the currently selected atom or bonds. See "help edit_keys"
for the exact combinations.  To build structures, you usually just
replace hydrogens with methyl groups, etc., and then repeat.  They are
no short-cuts currently available for building common groups, but that
is planned for later versions.

NOTE

Only "lines" and "sticks" representations can be picked using the
mouse, however other representations will not interfere with picking
so long as one of these representation is present underneath.

RELEASE NOTES

PyMOL is a free, open, and expandable molecular graphics system
written by computational scientists to enable molecular modeling from
directly within Python.  It will be of most benefit to hybrid
scientist/developers in the fields of structural biology,
computational chemistry, and informatics who seek an open and
unrestricted visualization tool for interfacing with their own
programs.  PyMOL will also be of benefit to advanced non-developers
familiar with similar programs such as Midas, O, Grasp, X-PLOR and
CNS.

PyMOL currently includes a diverse command language, a powerful
application programmers interface (API), and a variety of mouse and
keyboard driven functionality for viewing, animation, rendering, and
molecular editing.  A partial manual is now available on the web.

Two external GUI development options are supported for PyMOL:
"Tkinter" and "wxPython".  Developers can take their pick.

Note that only Tkinter is supported under Windows with the default
PyMOL and Python distributions, so for maximum ease of installation
under Windows, stick with Tkinter (Tcl/Tk).  For this reason, the
Tkinter-based GUI is going to be the default GUI for standard PyMOL
despite its drawbacks.

EDITING KEYS 

    These are defaults, which can be redefined.  Note that while
entering text on the command line, some of these control keys take on
text editing functions instead (CTRL - A, E, and K, and DELETE), so
you should clear the command line before trying to edit atoms.

ATOM REPLACEMENT

    CTRL-C    Replace picked atom with carbon   (C)
    CTRL-N    Replace picked atom with nitrogen (N)
    CTRL-O    Replace picked atom with oxygen   (O)
    CTRL-S    Replace picked atom with sulpher  (S)
    CTRL-G    Replace picked atom with hydrogen (H)
    CTRL-F    Replace picked atom with fluorene (F)
    CTRL-L    Replace picked atom with chlorine (Cl)
    CTRL-B    Replace picked atom with bromine  (Br)
    CTRL-I    Replace picked atom with iodine   (I)

ATOM MODIFICATION

    CTRL-J    Set charge on picked atom to -1
    CTRL-K    Set charge on picked atom to +1
    CTRL-D    Remove atom or bond (DELETE works too).
    CTRL-Y    Add a hydrogen to the current atom
    CTRL-R    Adjust hydrogens on atom/bond to match valence.
    CTRL-E    Inverts the picked stereo center, but you must first
                 indicate the constant portions with the (lb) and (rb)
                 selections.

    CTRL-T    Connect atoms in the (lb) and (rb) selections.
    CTRL-W    Cycle the bond valence on the picked bond.

UNDO and REDO of conformational changes (not atom changes!)

    CTRL-Z    undo the previous conformational change.
                 (you can not currently undo atom modifications).
    CTRL-A    redo the previous conformational change.

DESCRIPTION

    "run" executes an external Python script in a local name space,

    own namespace (as a module).

USAGE

    run file [, namespace ]

ARGUMENTS

    file = string: a Python program, typically ending in .py or .pym.
    
    namespace = local, global, module, main, or private 

PYMOL API

    Not directly available.  Instead, use cmd.do("run ...").

NOTES

    The default mode for run is "global".

    Due to an idiosyncracy in Pickle, you can not pickle objects
    directly created at the main level in a script run as "module",
    (because the pickled object becomes dependent on that module).
    Workaround: delegate construction to an imported module.

DESCRIPTION

    "spawn" launches a Python script in a new thread which will run
    concurrently with the PyMOL interpreter. It can be run in its own
    namespace (like a Python module, default), a local name space, or
    in the global namespace.

USAGE

    run python-script [, ( local | global | module | main | private )]

PYMOL API

    Not directly available.  Instead, use cmd.do("spawn ...").

NOTES

    The default mode for spawn is "module".

    Due to an idiosyncracy in Pickle, you can not pickle objects
    directly created at the main level in a script run as "module",
    (because the pickled object becomes dependent on that module).
    Workaround: delegate construction to an imported module.

    The best way to spawn processes at startup is to use the -l option
    (see "help launching").

DESCRIPTION

    API helper function. Get the full function name (incl. module) of
    given command.

ARGUMENTS

    name = string: name of a PyMOL command

NOTES

    The PyMOL Python Application Programming Interface (API) should be
    accessed exclusively through the "cmd" module (never "_cmd"!).  Nearly
    all command-line functions have a corresponding API method.

    from pymol import cmd
    result = cmd.<command-name>( argument , ... ) 

    Although the PyMOL core is not multi-threaded, the API is
    thread-safe and can be called asynchronously by external python
    programs.  PyMOL handles the necessary locking to insure that
    internal states do not get corrupted.  This makes it very easy to
    build complicated systems which involve direct realtime visualization.

MOVIES

    To create a movie, simply load multiple coordinate files
    into the same object.  This can be accomplish at the command line,
    using script files, or by writing PyMOL API-based programs.

    The commands:

load frame001.pdb,mov
load frame002.pdb,mov

    will create a two frame movie.  So will the following program:

from pymol import cmd

for a in ( "frame001.pdb","frame002.pdb" ):
    cmd.load(a,"mov")

    which can be executed at the command line using the "run" command.

    Python built-in glob module can be useful for loading movies.

from pymol import cmd
import glob
for a in ( glob.glob("frame*.pdb") ):
    cmd.load(a,"mov")

NOTE

    Because PyMOL stores all movie frames in memory, there is a
    a practical limit to the number of atoms in all coordinate files. 
    160 MB free RAM enables 500,000 atoms with line representations.
    Complex representations require significantly more memory.

DESCRIPTION

    PovRay: Persistance of Vision Support Information 

    The built-in ray-tracer (technically a ray-caster) is as fast or
    faster than PovRay for many figures (provided that hash_max is
    tuned appropriately for your content).  However, PovRay blows
    PyMOL away when it comes to rendering images without using lots of
    RAM, and with PovRay you get the ability use perspective,
    textures, reflections, infinite objects, and a superior lighting
    model.


    Assuming that PovRay is built and in your path...

    ray renderer=1   # will use PovRay instead of the built-in engine

    set ray_default_renderer=1 # changes the default renderer to PovRay
    ray                        # will now use PovRay by default

    cmd.get_povray() # will give you a tuple of PovRay input strings
                     # which you can manipulate from Python

PYMOL STEREOCHEMISTRY

      PyMOL can label chiral centers; however, due to the recursive and
      dependent nature of the determination, PyMOL will refuse to
      label structures with alternate coordinates.

      To determine stereochemistry for a structure that has alternate
      coordinates, you either need to clear the alternate coordinates
      field in the target object using:

     	   alter objName, alt=''

     or you need to create a new object from the old object selecting
     just one set of coordinates per atom.  For example, to create a
     new object called 'newObj' from 'oldObj' using the only those
     atoms with no alternate coordinates or those atoms with an
     alternate coordinate label 'A' one types:

     	  create newObj, oldObj and alt ''+alt 'A'

      Similarly, to create an object from just alternate coordinates
      'G' one types:

      	  create newObj, oldObj and alt 'G'

      PyMOL labels chiral centers using the IUPAC symbols 'R' for
      rectus, 'S' for sinister, 'r' for pseudoasymmetric rectus and
      's' for pseudoasymmetric sinister.

PYMOL ATOM TYPING

      PyMOL can label atom types with formats mol2/sybyl or macromodel/mmd.
      The global setting atom_type_format is used to determine which type
      is labelled.  Due to the recursive and dependent nature of the
      determination, PyMOL will refuse to label structures with alternate
      coordinates.

RAY TRACING OPTIMIZATION

    1. Reduce object complexity to a minimum acceptable level.
            For example, try lowering:
                "cartoon_sampling" 
                "ribbon_sampling", and
                "surface_quality", as appropriate.

    2. Increase "hash_max" so as to obtain a voxel dimensions of
        0.3-0.6.  Proper tuning of "hash_max" can speed up
        rendering by a factor of 2-5X for non-trivial scenes.

        WARNING: memory usage depends on hash_max^3, so avoid
        pushing into virtual memory.  Roughly speaking:

            hash_max = 80  -->   ~9 MB hash + data
            hash_max = 160 -->  ~72 MB hash + data
            hash_max = 240 --> ~243 MB hash + data

        Avoid utilizing virtual memory for the voxel hash,
        it will slow things way down.

    3. Recompiling with optimizations on usually gives a 25-33%
        performance boost for ray tracing.

DESCRIPTION

    "abort" abruptly terminates execution of the PyMOL command script
    without executing any additional commands.

        return None
    
    def skip(_self=cmd):

DESCRIPTION

    "skip" delimits a block of commands that are skipped instead of
    being executed.

EXAMPLE


    skip

    # the following command will not be executed
    color blue, all
    
    skip end

NOTES

    If the "skip" command is commented out, the subsequent "skip end"
    can be left in place, and will have no effect upon execution of
    subsequent commands.

EXAMPLE

    python

    for a in range(1,10):
