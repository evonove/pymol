<h3>Changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>PyMOL now informs the user and exits gracefully if launched using a
PWG which directs it to use a busy port.</li>

<li>The PyMOL JavaScript API has been extended with a buffering system
which can improve execution speed, reduce traffic, and guarantee
in-order execution even on browsers such as IE.</li>

<li>Four new sample mini-applications have been added.</li>

<li>HTML based discussion and documentation has been updated.</li>

</ul>
