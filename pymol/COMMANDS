--- MOUSE COMMANDS ---

Left: Rotation
Middle: XY Transloation
Right: Z Scale

Shift-Left: UP<->DOWN Front Plane, LEFT<->RIGHT Rear Plane

--- GENERAL COMMANDS ---

load <pdb-file>[,<molecule-name>[,<scene-number]]
	Loads PDB File

delete <molecule-or-selection-name>
	Deletes molecules or selections.

select <selection-name>=<selection-string>
	Create selection using XPLOR/CNS-like selection strings

color <color-name>,<molecule-or-selection-name>

show <lines|sticks|dots|mesh|spheres|ribbon>,<molecule-or-selection-name>
hide <lines|sticks|dots|mesh|spheres|ribbon>,<molecule-or-selection-name>
	Show or hide specific representations.

enable <molecule-name>
disable <molecule-name>

reset
	Restore default scene

turn <x|y|z>,<angle-in-degrees>
	Rotatation.

move <x|y|z>,<distance>
	Translation.

clip <near|far>,distance
	Movie near and far clipping planes.

png <png-file>
	Writes PNG file of current image.

refresh
	Forces a screen-redraw.

--- MOVIE MAKING ---

NOTE: To render a movie, shift-left click on the play (|>) button.

mset <movie-definition>

	<movie-definition> is repeating list of
		<scene-number> or
		x<repeat-count>
		-<target-scene>
	Example: "1 x10 1 -30 30 x10 30 -1" does the following:
		Shows scene 1; repeats a total of 10 times;
		shows scene 1; runs through scene 2 to 30;
		shows scene 30; repeats scene 30 a total of 10 times;
		shows scene 30; runs backwards through scene 29 to 1.
		At the end, the movie will start over.

mdo <frame-number>,<pymol-command>
	Sets up a command to be executed every time this frame is shown.
	NOTE: for this to work with ray-tracing, set single_image = 0

mclear
	Clears the movie frame cache.

mpng <png-prefix> [,<purge|save>]
	Writes numbered PNG files for all movie frames.  The purge
	often helps to save memory when writing very long movies.
	Generally good to issue "mclear" before "mpng"

mmatrix store
	Copies current transformation matrix for frame 1 of the movie

--- SETTINGS ---

set <parameter> = <value>

	Sets one of the following parameters:
		bonding_vdw_cutoff = <number>         
		min_mesh_spacing   = <number>
		dot_density        = <0..3>
		dot_surface        = <number>
		solvent_radius     = <number>
		sel_counter        = <number>
		bg_rgb             = <red:0..1> <green:0..1> <blue:0..1>
		ambient            = <0 to 1> ambient lighting 
		direct             = <0 to 1> intensity of surface emission
		reflect            = <number> intensity of light reflection
		light              = <vector> color of light
		power              = <number> numberical power of light reflection
		antialias          = <0 or 1>
		cavity_cull        = <number> cleans up pockets in meshes
		single_image       = <0 or 1> see below
		ribbon_radius      = <number> 
		min_delay          = <number> min millisec between frames
		stick_radius       = <number> thickness of stick bonds
		ortho              = <0 or 1> orthoscopic projection
		spec_reflect       = <number> intensity of specular reflection
		spec_power         = <number> numerical power of the specular ref.
		sweep_angle        = <number> angle of built-in rocking mechanism
		sweep_speed        = <number> speed of built-in rocking mechanism
		

		When single_image is true (1), all frames in the movie will
		be rendered independently.  When it is false (0), only frames
		with different molecular structures will be rendered independently.
		This enables caching of identical images, for example, when you
		want to hold a molecule in a fixed state for several seconds without
		changing the image at all.

--- MOVIE MAKING UTILITY MODULE: pmu ---

NOTE: usually it will be necessary to set single_image=1 when
	using the following commands.

pmu.mroll(<start_frame>,<stop_frame>,<looping>)

	Defines a series of "mdo" commands which will cause the 
	scene to rotate 360 degress about the Y-axis over the
	indicated frames.  

	Specifying 1 for <looping> means that the last frame will 
	line up properly rotated relative to the first frame.

	Specifying 0 for <looping> means that the last frame will 
	be rotated identical to the first frame (no rotation).

pmu.mrock(<start_frame>,<end_frame>,<angle>,<phase>,<looping>)

	Defines a series of "mdo" commands which will rotate the 
	molecule back and forth through the indicated angle.
	
	<phase> (0/1) indicates whether the molecule is initially at rest
	or in the middle of the rotation. (Usually specify 1)

	<looping> has the same meaning as above.	

	
--- SCRIPTS and PYTHON PROGRAMS ---

@<pymol-script-filename>
	
	Runs a pymol script (should end in ".pml" extension)

run <python-program>[,global]

	Runs a python program (should end in ".py" extension)
	If global is specified, then the program is run in the global namespace.
