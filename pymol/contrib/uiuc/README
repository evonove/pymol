Note that this special instance of the VMD plugin tree source code has
been automatically modified to work and compile within the PyMOL
environment.  Therefore, for all uses of this code other than
compilation of PyMOL, we urge you to refer back to the Theoretical and
Computational Biophysics Group at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/) for pristine copies of the
unmodified VMD plugin tree.  Please do not rely upon our modified copy
outside of the PyMOL context, since it may change unexpectedly.

Thank you for your cooperation, and let us all give thanks especially
to the VMD developers for their decision to release VMD plugins under
an unrestricted open-source license!
